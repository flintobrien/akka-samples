# Akka Samples

This project contains various samples for the [akka](http://akkasource.org) framework.  It''s based on my akka-template-rest project and tries to follow the latest releases of akka (which is a fairly moving target).  Akka has it''s own samples, so the code here may or may not be the recommended solution.  

Akka is an integration of many java/scala techologies, so many of my samples will be non-akka specific.

## Getting started
1. cd akka-samples
2. ./sbt (unix-based) or sbt (windows)
3. update
4. jetty-run
5. http://localhost:8080/
